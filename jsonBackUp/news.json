You'd be hard-pressed to find a high street or city centre that doesn't have at least a couple of bookmakers' shops mixed into it, offering bets on everything from horse racing and football to whether or not Kate Winslet will cry if she wins an Oscar (yes that was a real thing). But how does esports fit in?</p><p>According to a <a href=\"https://live-gamblecom.cloud.contensis.com/PDF/Virtual-currencies-eSports-and-social-casino-gaming.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">recent study by the UK's Gambling Commission</a>, the percentage of British adults who have at some point in their lives placed a bet on esports is 8.5 per cent, with three per cent having placed those bets in the month the study was conducted. That's a surprising statistic for a sport many consider to be still quite niche. And it makes sense most of those bets will be online, given the nature of esports and the audience for it. But it also got me wondering: just how easy it is to walk into a betting shop and wager some cash on an esports event?</p><p>To find out, I picked three (at the time of betting) upcoming and current events to bet on, with the intention of gambling on three specific teams to win either the tournament or a particular match. These were Team Liquid to win the ESL One Dota 2 tournament, Ninjas in Pyjamas to win that day's ECS CS:GO season six game, and for the Overwatch World Cup, I had to back the home nation and bet on the UK. Secondly, I decided I had to be able to place the bet in store. We all know you can bet on esports online, so that didn't count.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-13-how-uk-bookies-are-handling-the-rising-influence-of-esports\">Read more&hellip;</a></p>","feedlabel":"Eurogamer","date":1544688000,"feedname":"eurogamer","feed_type":0,"appid":570},{"gid":"2416641943185682737","title":"Dota 2 Update -

haven&apos;t disappeared just yet. Amazon is running deals all week long, and some of our favorite deals from other sites are still active, too, in both the US and UK. This is the best time of year to find sales and deals on graphics cards, gaming monitors, mice, keyboards, and more.</p><p>There are still savings to be found on monitors, prebuilt PCs, graphics cards, and chairs, especially. Each of those categories below is still filled out with deals. So are most of the others. There aren&apos;t as many deals as there were from the height of Black Friday, but the discounts that remain active are still just as good.</p><p>Not sure what to buy this Cyber Monday? The first thing is do your homework. Figure out what components you want to upgrade, and do your research to figure out which parts are best for you. (Our <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/buying-guides/\"><u>hardware buying guides</u></a> are great for advice on that front.) Once you&apos;ve figured out your target deals, check how much they&apos;re usually sold for using a tool like <a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/\"><u>PCPartPicker</u></a> or <a href=\"https://camelcamelcamel.com/\"><u>CamelCamelCamel</u></a>. That way you can tell how much money (if any) you&apos;re actually saving.</p><p>While we haven&apos;t seen too many deals on Nvidia&apos;s new RTX graphics cards, we&apos;ve actually seen some great deals <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-omen-by-hp-obelisk-desktop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-2tb-hard-drive-256gb-ssd-hp-finish-in-shadow-black/6285801.p?skuId=6285801\">on gaming PCs with RTX graphics</a>. There have also been some great accessory sales, like up to 50 percent off Logitech gear. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#section-ssds-and-hdds\">SSDs</a> are also a hot commodity this year.

We&apos;ll have a team working around the clock combing through thousands of deals&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;to find sales on our favorite components and deep discounts on other great hardware. We&apos;ll let you know if a deal is worth considering, or if it&apos;s even a good deal in the first place.</p><p>To get the best deals, we recommend checking back often as new deals go live&#x2014;and as we curate more and more of the best ones we can find.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Stick with PC Gamer</h3>\n<p>Our team will be working around the clock through the holiday season scouring the digital store shelves for the best PC gaming deals to be found.

Some even more affordable systems use previous-gen 1080s, 1080 Tis, and 1070s. If you don&apos;t need the latest and greatest, those are a good choice.</p><p>Expect to see steeper discounts on desktops using AMD&apos;s processors from last year&#x2014;the 1600X, 1700X, and 1800X Ryzen CPUs. For example, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D5S3LZM\">this iBUYPOWER PC</a> with an 1800X and an RX 580 already <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/get-an-ibuypower-gaming-desktop-with-a-ryzen-7-1800x-and-rx-580-for-dollar799/\">dropped to $799 once</a>.

Now that manufacturers have plenty of excess stock, you can expect to see some great deals this year.</p><p>Nvidia&apos;s new <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/geforce-rtx-2070-founders-edition-review/\"><u>RTX 2070</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-founders-edition-review/\"><u>RTX 2080</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-ti-founders-edition-review/\"><u>2080 Ti</u></a> cards bring ray-tracing to mainstream hardware, and we&apos;re looking for the best discounts we can find on them, though there won&apos;t be anything massive. However, there will almost certainly be great deals on last-gen GTX 10-series cards, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-deals/\"><u>GTX 1080</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/geforce-gtx-1070-ti-review/\"><u>GTX 1070 Ti</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-geforce-gtx-1070-review/\"><u>GTX 1070</u></a>.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday graphics card deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-graphics-card-deals\"><em>Jump to UK&#xA0;Black Friday graphics card deals</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>US deals</strong></p>\n<h3>UK&#xA0;Black Friday graphics card deals&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in monitor deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday&#xA0;</h3>\n<p>Vendors typically leverage the holiday shopping season to clear out older inventories. It&apos;s rare to see a brand new product go on sale, so we didn&apos;t expect there to be any significant discounts on monitors like the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/asus-rog-swift-pg27uq-monitor-brings-hdr-and-g-sync-together/\">Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-4k-hdr-monitor-with-g-sync-is-available-to-preorder-for-dollar2000/\">Acer Predator X27</a>, the pair of 4K 144Hz monitors with HDR and G-Sync support (everything but the kitchen sink, in other words).

We also anticipate deals on monitors supporting AMD&apos;s first generation Freesync technology. AMD has been pushing an updated &apos;<a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/freesync-2-hdr-explained/\">Freesync 2 HDR</a>&apos; certification, so vendors will likely look to clear room for newer models.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday 2018 monitor deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-monitor-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday monitor deals</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>US deals</strong></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday monitor deals</h3>\n<p><strong>Australia deals</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in SSD deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>\n<p>Solid state drives have been on a steady price decline over the past few years, thanks to lower manufacturing costs and greater competition. This has accelerated <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-ssd-deals-today\">in the past few months</a>, leaving SSD prices at an all-time low. Most 500GB SATA drives are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Power-Performance-Internal-SP512GBSS3A55S25/dp/B07997QV4Z\">less than $100</a>, and 1TB models are <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-MX500-NAND-SATA-Internal/dp/B077SF8KMG\">typically around $150</a>. Faster M.2 disks are still more expensive than their SATA counterparts, but not by much; 500GB NVMe M.2 drives run for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-970-EVO-250GB-MZ-V7E250BW/dp/B07BN4NJ2J\">about $150</a>.</p><p>This Black Friday, you can expect SSD prices to drop to absurdly-low prices.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday SSD and HDD deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-ssd-and-hdd-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday SSD and HDD deals</em></a></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday SSD and HDD deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in motherboard deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday&#xA0;</h3>\n<p>Z390 boards are already stocked at online retailers but are new, so they won&apos;t offer the best deals. Most Z370 boards also have updated BIOSes to accommodate the new 9th gen Cores. If you are thinking on splurging on one of Intel&apos;s new CPUs, but need a new motherboard to go with it, you don&apos;t need to rush to get the newest one.</p><p>As for motherboards with AMD chipsets, there were a few deals last year on motherboards that supported both first gen and second gen Ryzen processors, like the ASUS ROG Strix X370-F, so it seems likely we&apos;ll see those deals again. Of course, if you aren&apos;t sure what to put on your shopping list when the time comes, you can always take a look at our recommendations for the <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-motherboards/\"><u>best gaming motherboards</u></a>.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday motherboard deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-motherboard-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday motherboard deals</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>AMD motherboard deals</strong></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday motherboard deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in CPU deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>\n<p>Intel just launched its 9th-generation &quot;Coffee Lake refresh&quot; Core processors, including the <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117959&amp;cm_re=9th_gen_intel-_-19-117-959-_-Product\"><u>i5-9600K</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117958&amp;cm_re=9th_gen_intel-_-19-117-958-_-Product\"><u>i7-9600K</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117957&amp;cm_re=9th_gen_intel-_-19-117-957-_-Product\"><u>i9-9900k</u></a>. Don&apos;t expect big deals there. On the plus side, retailers might be more inclined to clear out their existing inventories of 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) and 8th-gen (Coffee Lake) Intel CPUs.</p><p>When it comes to AMD, we&apos;re looking for steep discounts on first generation Ryzen processors. Something else to consider is that if you&apos;re looking for a new CPU, you probably also need a new motherboard. Check the combined total for both parts, as there might be bigger discounts on the motherboard side that can make up for a smaller CPU discount.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday CPU deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-cpu-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday CPU deals</em></a></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday CPU deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Black Friday gaming mouse deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-gaming-mouse-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday gaming mouse deals</em></a></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday gaming mouse deals</h3>\n<h3>Black Friday gaming keyboard deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-gaming-keyboard-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday gaming keyboard deals</em></a></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday gaming keyboard deals&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>Black Friday webcam deals</h3>\n<h3>Other accessory deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in PC case deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>\n<p>There are so many PC cases out there, you&apos;re bound to find one you like on sale.

However, discounts that most retailers offer around this time will likely work on inventory they carry that&apos;s eligible for percentages off, even if there&apos;s not a sale on a gaming chair per se.&#xA0;</p><p>Amazon offered a few gaming chairs for Prime Day recently, such as the Respawn 110 Racing Style Leather Gaming Chair for $139.99, down from its original price of $497, among a few other deals, so we&apos;re watching for similar deals for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>\n<h3>Black Friday gaming chair deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-gaming-chair-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday gaming chair deals</em></a></p>\n<p><strong>US deals</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Black Friday computer desk deals</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Black Friday PSU deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/black-friday-2018-and-cyber-monday-2018-pc-gaming-deals/#uk-black-friday-psu-deals\"><em>Jump to UK Black Friday PSU deals</em></a></p>\n<h3>UK Black Friday PSU deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What we&apos;re looking for in case fan and CPU cooler deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday</h3>\n<p>There haven&apos;t been any radical advancements in fan technology or CPU coolers over the past year, so there aren&apos;t any specific products you should keep an eye out for.

This year Cyber Monday 2018 is Monday November 26.</p>\n<h3>What&apos;s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday?</h3>\n<p>Black Friday began as a day of shopping sales at brick-and-mortar stores, with Cyber Monday later joining it as the day for finding online deals. But as online shopping has risen to stratospheric levels (have you seen how much Amazon is worth lately?), you can expect to see deals both in-store and online starting on Black Friday (and earlier), and continuing through the weekend.&#xA0;</p><p>Some companies and retailers release all of their planned sales on Black Friday, while others divvy them up throughout the weekend, or hold some deals to push live on Cyber Monday. We&apos;ll have a team working around the clock combing through thousands of deals&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;to find sales on our favorite components and deep discounts on other great hardware. We&apos;ll let you know if a deal is worth considering, or if it&apos;s even a good deal in the first place.</p><p>To get the best deals, we recommend checking back often as new deals go live&#x2014;and as we curate more and more of the best ones we can find.&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Stick with PC Gamer</h3>\n<p>Our team will be working around the clock through the holiday season scouring the digital store shelves for the best PC gaming deals to be found. Check back often as we track down the best pre-Black Friday deals, and of course visit us on Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see all the best PC gaming deals to be had.</p><p>And if you&apos;re feeling burnt out on Black Friday, have some fun and blow off some steam by smashing lovely aisles of stocked shelves in <a href=\"https://indiegamesplus.com/2018/11/knock-everything-off-the-shelves-in-black-friday-the-ultimate-shopping-simulator\">Black Friday: The Ultimate Shopping Simulator</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#main\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p>\n<h3>Game deals</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://vanilla.tools/pcgamer/articles/ySFbMepDwW4C2E59u77gwU#main\"><u><strong>Back to top</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><em>Some online stores give us a small cut if you buy something through one of our links.

On November 7 and 8 combined, the game received nearly 4,000 negative reviews.</p><p>On Friday, Chinese pro player and coach Xu &quot;BurNIng&quot; Zhilei shared an email about the incidents that appeared to be from Valve&apos;s Erik Johnson. In the email exchange, translated by Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/9vhibe/cyborgmatt_on_twitter_earlier_today_burning/\" target=\"_blank\">WhoIsEarthshaker</a>, Johnson said the pro players&apos; comments were &quot;very offensive and inappropriate&quot;, and that Valve would step in if a pro player that made racist comments was not punished by their team. It would also be contacting TNC regarding Kuku&apos;s comments, he said.</p><p>He did not respond directly to BurNing&apos;s call for &quot;clear rules&quot; governing punishments for racist launguage.&#xA0;</p><p>Valve did, however, write a post on the Dota 2 blog yesterday in which it said that racist language between pro players &quot;is really damaging to the entire Dota community.</p><p>&quot;It pits fans against each other, belittles and demeans entire groups and makes them feel like they are not as important. Going forward, we expect all teams who participate in our tournaments to hold its players accountable, and be prepared to follow up with strong punishments when players represent Dota and its community poorly.&quot;</p><p>Valve did not clarify what would happen if teams did not dish out &quot;strong punishments&quot; for racist abuse, or say what it thought constituted a strong punishment. It continued:</p><p>&quot;We&#x2019;ve always had an approach of letting the players be themselves, and to express themselves freely. That&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s always been for a long time. However, we also expect pro players to understand that they represent the Dota community regardless of where they are. Words carry a lot of meaning.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;Some people may not agree or understand why certain words are harmful, but it doesn&#x2019;t make it any less so to those on the receiving end. The language used by multiple players over the last week has caused many of our fans a lot of pain and is not behavior that we condone.&quot;</p><p>You can read Valve&apos;s <a href=\"http://blog.dota2.com/2018/11/the-major-and-professional-dota-players/\" target=\"_blank\">full statement here</a>.</p><p>Thanks, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-11-valve-responds-to-chinese-players-review-bombing-dota-2-after-racist-taunts\" target=\"_blank\">Eurogamer</a>.</p>","feedlabel":"PC Gamer","date":1541948036,"feedname":"pcgamer","feed_type":0,"appid":570}],"count":1856}}
